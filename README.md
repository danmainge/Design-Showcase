# Design-Showcase
A website showcasing some of my Logo Designs.
## By Charlie Migwi

# Description
Logos are a great way of selling a brand. Customers will first interact with a logo during advertising and marketing and it is for this reason that a logo should be well articulated. Simple logos are straight to the point and are easily undersood. The logos I have showcased are simple as they should be.

# Behavior Driven Environment (BDD)
The website shows images alongside their captions. when scrolling down, cards fade in from right and left bringing out the website functionality.

# Setup/ Installation
The application requires a HTML5 enabled browser to run. It also requires a text editor to open, view and edit code. Clicking the link in the description will open and run the app in the current tab.

# Technologies Used
The webpage uses HTML. Styling is entirely done using CSS. The highlight of the webpage is the use of the AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library by  @michalsnik. Here is the Github link for the library https://github.com/michalsnik/aos.
